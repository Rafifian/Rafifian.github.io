                            <p>    February 27, 2001. Saint Louis, Missouri. The night is pitch black, thick with silence. Like a rock, the building stands tall in the night, proud and official. Like a fungus, it sprawls across the ground, drawing from the earth,always growing. Inside, men and women in white coats and hairnets flow through sterile hallways, like water through a tulip's xylem. In a specific room, there is a woman, who, while preoccupied with the parasite inside of her, thinks of her daughter, at home with a baby sitter. She thinks she is never going to see her again, the pain taking over, but she refuses to fade. Next to her, the father holds onto her hand for dear life. He stares into her face and thinks of all the good things to come--no, prays for them--in a valiant attempt to not spill his dinner all over his wife. The mother screams, the father clenches her hand tighter, and into this world comes yet another soul: me. Despite the hype, it's not as big of a deal as it seems.</p>

                            <p>When I was half-a-year old, my father had the compulsion to move back to his home, Tenerife. Like all good wives, my mother complied, taking me, my sister (who is exactly a year and four days older than me), and all of our belongings with her on this brand new adventure. There, we lived in a condominium: white brick, two or three stories. The roof was flat, and that was where we hung our clothes to dry or played on sunny days. Down a staircase, in our living room, my sister would march, imitating the fishseller who passed by every morning. My parents ate spatchcock chicken and rich paella and all the seafood they could ever want. However, this life was short lived--we returned to The States when I was one. I don't remember any of this, except through pictures my mother shows me.</p>
                            <p>We lived in Saint Louis, Missouri for a short time before making the move to the small town of Rockwall, Texas. I don't remember the first few years of my time there, but I can recall some: watching fireworks out of my sister's bedroom window on the Fourth of July, eating my father's oregano he grew by the front door after a day at school, digging up grubs in the garden, walking home the three blocks from school with my father and sister, waking up in the early morning to lay in bed with my parents, watching the cars on the news in an attempt to find my mother as she drove home from work, ordering chinese food from a restaurant in the historic downtown, eating honeysuckle at the bottom of the hill by the school with my friends. I remember my time in Rockwall as one long day in the summertime, full of smiles.</p>

                            <p>The time between my early life and now is filled with movement and change, but I won't get into it. In short, I moved with my mother and sister to a different town in Texas for the remainder of elementary school, and then again to Missouri for middle school and the first half of high school.</p>
                            <p>Now, I attend MICDS. I play clarinet and videogames in my free time and enjoy going out to dinner with my friends. I am an ex-swimmer and current (though out of shape) cross country runner. An aspiring composer, full of ideas, but not quite sure how to put them on paper. An arranger and coordinater of <strong>the</strong> best jazz ensemble. An enjoyer of Magic: the Gathering and other logic games. A decent speedcuber. Ex-LEGO builder, current web developer and musician. Lover of food, condemned to clumsiness. Regretfully allergic to dogs and cats (though, that doesn't stop me from petting them). All in all, a human. You could say I'm a lot of things, but who isn't?</p>
